Immediate To-Do's
- Fix Major Bugs
- Autolevel Code
- Tables


Major Bugs:
- Seizing causes major stat wonk.
- Unit screen is extremely screwed.

Minor Bugs:
- Graphical bug on mend use description. Probably unintended to use narrowfont here.
- Droppable/Stealable Graphic appears when silencing a unit.
- S Rank doesnt go epic green
- Summon (and possibly other actions) giving too much exp in fatigue state when a 1HP unit so the logic somewhere in my CHAX is probably bad.
