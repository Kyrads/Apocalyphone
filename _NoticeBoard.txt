Minor Bugs:
- Graphical bug on mend use description. Probably unintended to use narrowfont here.
- Droppable/Stealable Graphic appears when silencing a unit.
- S Rank doesnt go epic green
- Summon (and possibly other actions) giving too much exp in fatigue state when a 1HP unit so the logic somewhere in my CHAX is probably bad.
- Bow Knight anim hangs when using the shortbow at 1 range.
